### ordered_random_intercept.stan ###
Stan model file to for an ordered category logit model with a random intercept term in the linear predictor

### ordered_fixed.stan ###
Stan model file for a fixed effects ordered logit model


### ordered_random_multi.stan ###
Stan model file for ordered logit model with multiple random intercepts (random slopes) in linear predictor

### ordered_random_cutpoints.stan ###
Stan model file for ordered logit with random cutpoint parameters

## ordered_random_cutint.stan  ### 
Stan model file for ordered logit with random cutpoints AND random intercept in the linear predictor

###  WW_fixed_test.R ###
Example model fit code (fixed effects in this case) for only fields in winter wheat, used for loo cross validation comparisons between models. 
 
#### BaselineLogit_Examples.R ####
Fits three different parameterisations of a baseline category logit model to real data. Including a fixed effects model, a model with a constrained single random intercept for target state, and a model with a random intercept for each target state.

#### BaselineLogit_explicit.R ####
Fits a multi-state random intercept model explicitly, rather than using the built in 'categorical_logit' sampling statement in STAN.


#### OrderedLogit_Examples.R ####
Fits three different parameterisations of an ordered logit model to real data. Includes a fixed effect model, constrained single random intercept and multi-state random intercept model. 

#### Stan_validation.R ####
Fits a multi-state random intercept model to data collected in the first set of surveys, 2007-2008.

#### PredictOrdered.R ####
Contains functions to calculate transition probabilites from StanFit objects and plot simple assessments of model fit. Including a field by field distribution of observed vs predicted density distributions and observed vs predicted transition matrices. 


#### rotation_2007_2008_2009_2010.csv ####
Black-grass density state data from RELU weed survey from years 2008-2010.
